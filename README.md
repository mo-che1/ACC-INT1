This is a project taken from my dissertation on Bioinspired Material Design Using Combinatorial Cell Complexes for the purpose of the technical interiview.

Small context for the project:

  This codes intended purpose is to facilitate the recreation of bamboo microstructures to a usable simulated model to enable bioinspired material design, the simulation package is called Neper
  and uses a Linux shell. Neper uses voronoi tesselation which inserts a line at the midpoint between 2 chosen seed points. The code creates these seed points from the use of clustering coefficients and 
  attempts to provide seeds appropriate enough to model the bamboo.
